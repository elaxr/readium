# Readium

A wordpress theme inspired by Medium.com.

It's really great.

## Features

- Site-wide header image support
- Per post feature image that displays at the top of the page like the header image (replacing the header image when set)
- *Resources* custom post type that provides the ability to post links to books, music, services, etc. The listing page shows in a staggered grid kind of like Pinterest.
- Custom header image for the resources listing page (yoururl.com/resources)
- Responsive design with "drawer" for main menu and widgets
- Footer widget area and footer menu area

## Notes on Using

This theme has been customized to be used on a specific site. While the header image can be customized using the WP Customize settings, the colors must be changed in the css/style.less file (then the stylesheet would need to be recompiled.) Therefore, if you want to use this theme, you'll probably want to branch it and make you changes.

You can contact me or file an issue if you need any help.
